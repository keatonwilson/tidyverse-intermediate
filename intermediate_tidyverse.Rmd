# Introduction  
The goal of this workshop is to use a real-world data set (police 
stops in Minneapolis in 2017) to work through a bunch of the Tidyverse's more 
advanced functions. The workshop is catered to users who have some familiarity 
with the Tidyverse's main principles (tidy data, the pipe, ggplot2) but want to 
take their knowledge a step further to do more complex data manipulation, 
summaries and graphing.  

In this workshop we'll cover:  
1. Data overview  
2. Filtering data  
3. Mutations (not the biological kind)  
4. Group operations  
5. Summaries  
6. Joins  
7. Pushing into ggplot
